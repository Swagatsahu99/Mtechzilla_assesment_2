## Getting Started with Create React App

In this app, you can search for any random Github user by just their username
## Features
- This app has an input box and a button. If you click the submit button, the user card will be displayed on the UI. If the input box is empty and you try to submit the empty data, it will give an error, or if you type user name, if the username is not available on github at that time, you will also get the error.

- If you successfully overcome all the errors, you will get a user details card on the UI, and thatÂ card will contain the following details:
 Avatar Image ( avatar_url )
 - Username ( login )
 - Name ( name )
 - No. of public repos ( public_repos )
 - No. of public gists ( public_gists )
 - Profile created at in time format of YYYY-MM-DD. ( created_at )
